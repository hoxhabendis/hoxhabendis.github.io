<h2>Cupping Therapy for Shoulder and Neck Pain</h2>
<br /><img src="img/Shoulder-and-Neck-Pain.jpg">
<br /><p>Did you know that close to 65% Americans between the age of 18 and 35 experience chronic neck and shoulder pain? If you were under the impression that only older people have this problem, think again because neck and shoulder pain is more common that you think. And, cupping therapy may well be one of the most effective healing modalities that can help you with the condition.
</p>
<br /><h3>Causes of Neck and Shoulder Pain
</h3>
<br /><p>
    Neck and shoulder pain can result from many factors, only one of which is an injury that hasn’t healed despite your taking care of it. While arthritis and meningitis are medical causes, other factors that can contribute to the condition include a strain, or sprain. You can also have neck and shoulder pain because of poor posture or spending long hours at a desk job without moving and changing your position.

If you accidentally slept for too long in an awkward pose or made a sudden move with your neck, you might have severe pain. As an athlete, if you play a sport that involves the use of your shoulder muscles, you can develop chronic pain. Do keep in mind that sometimes, headaches and migraines can also result from neck pain.

<br /><h4>How Cupping Therapy is Performed
</h4>
<br /><p>
 As the National Center for Biotechnology Information reports, cupping must be performed on the specific acupuncture points that are the focal points of the injured tissues. A certified therapist is trained in identifying these trigger points and knows how to locate them. They are the LI 15, SI 15, and GB 21 of the soft tissues on the neck and shoulders.

<br />Each cupping session lasts for around 20 to 30 minutes. You will be asked to sit in a chair with your feet resting on the ground with the neck and shoulders exposed. Alternatively, you might be asked to lie on the therapist’s table face down. Cups will be placed on the acupuncture points after which suction is caused by way of a pump or any other technique. After a few minutes, the cups are removed. This technique is dry cupping.

<br />Depending on the severity of the pain and your comfort levels, your therapist might offer to use wet cupping or massage cupping. Some therapists may also suggest a combination of cupping therapy with acupuncture for better pain relief. You can rest assured that all precautions will be taken to maintain hygienic, sterile conditions so that there is no possibility of side effects and infections.

<br />Again, depending on how you respond to the treatment, your therapist can suggest that you come back for 4 to 6 follow-up sessions taken once a week. You’re likely to notice a few red marks and bruises but they are not painful to the touch and clear away within a few days.

<br />With each progressive session, patients typically talk about how the stiffness and pain eases, and they find that movement is much easier. You can rely on cupping therapy as a non-invasive, safe modality to help you get relief from neck and shoulder pain. Though, you must inform your medical practitioner about the therapy you’re getting so he can plan your other medications and treatment accordingly.
